## Best Practices

### Information Consistency

**Critical**: Your NAP (Name, Address, Phone) must be IDENTICAL across all platforms.

**✅ Correct**:
```
NorthStack Solutions
123 Main Street SW, Calgary, AB T2P 1A1
+1-403-555-0123
```

**❌ Wrong** (inconsistent):
```
Northstack Solutions          ← Different capitalization
123 Main St SW, Calgary AB   ← Missing comma, different abbreviation
(403) 555-0123               ← Different phone format
```

### Optimization Tips

1. **Complete Every Field**: 100% complete profiles rank higher
2. **Use Keywords Naturally**: Include "DevOps Calgary", "IT automation", "cloud services", etc.
3. **Add Photos**: Businesses with photos get 42% more direction requests and 35% more clicks
4. **Collect Reviews**: Ask satisfied clients for reviews (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn)
5. **Update Regularly**: Keep hours current, add posts, update photos
6. **Monitor & Respond**: Reply to reviews and messages within 24 hours
7. **Track Performance**: Use analytics from each platform

### Review Management

**How to Ask for Reviews**:
```
Hi [Client Name],

We're glad you're happy with [project/service]! If you have a moment,
would you mind leaving a review on Google? It helps other Canadian
businesses find us.

Here's the link: [Google Review Link]
